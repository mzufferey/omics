Harrellâ€™s concordance index C is defined as the proportion of observations that the model can order correctly in terms of survival times ( Steck et al. [2008]). This can be interpreted as a generalization of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) that considers censored data. It represents the global encapsulation of the model discrimination power and its ability to provide a reliable ranking of the survival times based on the individual risk scores. In

Pathways represent a group of biochemical entities (e.g.,
genes, proteins, etc.), connected by interactions, relations, and reactions (including physical interactions, complex formation, transcriptional regulation, etc.), that lead to a certain product or changes in a cell. Molecular



median absolute deviation

median of the absolute deviations from data's median

$MAD=median(|X_i - \tilde{X}|)$ where $\tilde{X} = median(X)$

 is a measure of [statistical dispersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion). Moreover, the MAD is a [robust statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistic), being more resilient to outliers in a data set;a [robust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_statistics) measure of the [variability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_dispersion) of a [univariate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate) sample of [quantitative data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_data)

often used to select highly variable gene (e.g. Campbell and Yau 2018:  select ~5'000 genes with MAD in log(TPM+1) expression > 0 or > sqrt(0.5))

The final outputs from clinical transformer are: (1) Predicted scores - output from the final layer of fully connected neural network with linear activation function. (2) A list of attention matrices of

The length of this list corresponds to the number of transformer layers.
