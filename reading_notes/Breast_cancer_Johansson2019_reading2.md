, 13,997 protein products of 12,645 genes were identified
at a 1% protein false-discovery rate (FDR) based on 248,949 identified unique peptides (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1A, B, Supplementary Data S1). The subset of 9995 proteins quantified (with a median of 12 unique peptides/protein and 24 PSMs/ protein for quantification) in each of the 45 tumors, based on gene symbol centric quantification (denoted proteins henceforth), is used for all quantitative proteome analyses (i.e.,

Core sets of tumors whose proteomes are representative of a proteome-based grouping are defined using unsupervised cluster- ing based on high-variance protein (n = 1334) abundance profiles (Supplementary Methods), producing six consensus core tumor clusters (CoTC) (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 4C–K). CoTC assignments overlap with PAM50 normal-like and luminal A classifications, but divide PAM50 basal-like tumors into two groups, and combine HER2 and luminal B while maintaining a separate group of luminal B PAM50 subtype tumors (Fig. 2c, d, Supplementary Fig. 3I). Unsupervised clustering of CPTAC breast tumor proteomes5, using the overlapping high-variance proteins (632 of 1334), identifies three tumor clusters that resemble CoTC1 (basal-like), CoTC3 (luminal A), and CoTC6 (a mix of luminal B and HER2) (Supplementary Fig. 5A, B). Ofnote, the CPTAC patient cohort does not have a defined normal-like tumor subtype.





---

three main classical subtypes are defined by expression of the oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR; ERPR positive breast cancer) and the epidermal growth factor receptor ErbB2/Her2 (Her2 positive). The triple negative (TN) form (where none of the three markers is expressed) has an especially poor prognosis.

These subtypes matured into four accepted subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, Her2-enriched and basal-like breast cancer. While they do not perfectly reflect the clinical subtypes, most luminal tumours are ER/PR-positive, most Her2-enriched ones harbour the gene amplification, and most basal tumours are triple negative

Another attempt to bring the molecular classification of
breast cancer into the clinical practice has been to identify surrogate markers that would allow the identification of the molecular subtypes using the more familiar immunohistochemical approach. Accordingly, the combined evaluation of ER, PgR, HER2 and Ki67 immunoreactivity would approximate the molecular classification of luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched and basal-like breast cancers [25]. It should be noted, however, that the immunohistochemically and molecularly defined classes do not overlap completely. As an example, some basal-like breast cancers (according to the molecular classification) will not show the expected triple- negative (ER, PgR and HER2 negative) immunophenotype, and vice versa not all the immunohistochemically triple- negative breast cancer will be classified as basal-like by gene expression profiling [26].



the assignment of basal-like and ERBB2+ (HER2+) breast cancers to the poor-prognosis groups by first-generation gene signatures is determined mainly by high expres- sions of proliferation-related genes [



expression of genes involved in cell proliferation is the most heavily weighted compo- nent in calculating the recurrence score [4] and is the basis of genomic grading [5,6]



The breast is comprised of two main types of tissue: (a) glandular tissues that house
lobules (i.e., milk-producing glands) and ducts, and (b) stromal tissues, which provide the “supporting framework” of the breast (i.e., fatty and connective tissues)



The invasive form of breast cancer is seen to breach the duct and lobular wall, invading the breast's supporting tissues. Despite that, this does not imply its metastatic capability, as some breast cancer can be invasive but do not spread further to other organs or lymph nodes.

The other form of breast cancer is carcinoma in situ or non-invasive breast cancer, which can be subcategorized into two types: either ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Generally, DCIS is considered as pre-invasive or non-invasive breast cancer and constitutes one in five new breast cancer cases reported. However, untreated DCIS may spread over time by invading into adjacent breast tissue and progress into invasive cancer. 



Perou and team studied the gene expression of different breast cancer types using cDNA
microarray profiling and sorted them into few intrinsic gene subtypes: basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) (estrogen receptor (ER) negative, progesterone-receptor (PR) negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) negative), HER2-enriched, normal breast-like, luminal subtype A (ER+ and low grade) and luminal subtype B (ER+ and often high grade)[25– 27] and the poorly described triple-negative subtype or “claudin-low” subtype [25–27] (Figure 1). Each of these molecular subgroups has a distinctive prognosis and chemotherapy sensitivity.



the growth of breast cancer cells can be induced by hormones, estrogen,
and progesterone. Thus, selecting specific therapy for breast cancer varies depending on these hormone receptors' expression[28,29]. Generally, 70% of breast cancer patients express ER and receive hormonal therapy treatment[28,30,31]. Studies also indicated that those with luminal-like cancers seem to have better long-term survival compared with other cancers, but those with basal-like and HER-2-positive tumors show higher susceptibility and sensitivity towards chemotherapy[26,32]. In contrast, patients diagnosed with triple-negative cancer have exceptionally shorter survival in first metastatic occurrence than other breast cancer types[33



By molecular classification, ER-positive luminal breast cancer is the most common type
of invasive breast cancer. The ER-positive disease can be further classified into subtypes with different outcomes (i.e., luminal A and luminal B) using gene expression profiling with microarrays[34]. Luminal A tumors tend to have high expression of ER-activated genes, low- grade histological appearance, and slower growth, resulting in a better prognosis than luminal B tumors[35]. Furthermore, luminal A tumors are associated with the expression of luminal epithelial cytokeratins (CK) 8 and 18, other genes such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 alpha (FOXA1), B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), erbB3, and erbB4[36]. In comparison, luminal B tumors typically display a high proliferate rate and tumor aggressiveness, which is subsequently explained by its high relapse rate and lower survival rates than luminal-A breast cancer[37–40]. The main difference between these two luminal subtypes is the greater level of proliferation- related genes expressions such as avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (v-MYB), gamma glutamyl hydrolase (GGH), lysosome-associated transmembrane protein 4-beta (LAPTMB4), nuclease sensitive element binding protein 1 (NSEP1) and cyclin E1 (CCNE1) in luminal-B tumors[41]. It should be noted that luminal tumors form a continuum, thus the determination of these tumors into two subtypes based on proliferation may be arbitrary[42



The HER2 is overexpressed in 15–30% of invasive breast cancer, mainly due to the
overexpression of HER2/HER2 signaling-related genes and genes located in the HER2 amplicon on chromosome 17q12[25]. Even though HER2-enriched breast cancer can proliferate faster than luminal cancers, they are often highly responsive to targeted therapies aimed at the HER2 protein, resulting in remarkably improved outcomes[43]. The normal cell-like subgroup, comprising 5–10% of breast cancer patients[44]. Some researchers defined that this subtype was featured by similar gene expression to normal breast epithelium. Its proliferation rate is often low and responds to adjuvant chemotherapy[44,45].
The BLBC is an aggressive subtype that mainly occurs in young women and displays
exceptionally high metastasis rates to the brain and lung[46,47]. This subtype is characterized by high histological grade, poor tubule formation, central necrotic zones, pushing borders, high mitotic indices, and proliferation rates[47]. Furthermore, the BLCL does not benefit from anti- estrogen hormonal treatment or trastuzumab as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 were not expressed in this subtype. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular background of BLBC to develop promising therapeutic regimes is necessary[48]. For instance, a study conducted by Hallett et al.[49] distinguished BLBC into two subgroups based on 14-gene. They assumed that this categorization might provide aggressive therapeutic regimes to the poor prognosis subgroup while avoiding such treatment in low-risk patients[5



Luminal Cancers Luminal cancers have an immunophenotypic
pattern similar to the epithelial, luminal component of the milk ducts of the normal mammary gland, mainly expressing low molecular weight luminal cytokeratins



(CK7, CK8, CK18, etc.), E receptors and associated genes (LIV1 and cyclin D1)19
. They have low asso-
ciation with proliferative genes. Three groups are distinguished from the IHC point of view: Luminal A, Luminal B and HER2 luminal. Luminal A subtype (E+, Pr+, HER2- and Ki-67
<14%) It is the most common and least aggressive
subtype, with a very good prognosis, with very low expression of proliferative genes. Here, E-positive, Pr-positive (at least 20%) and HER2-negative receptor tumors are classified, with a low Ki-67, less than 14%. That is how tubular carcinoma and infiltrating cancers (both ductal and lobular) of histological grade I and II (Figure 1) are. By expressing E receptors, these carcinomas are
susceptible to being treated with hormone therapy (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors), in addition to surgical or radio/CT treatment that may be required. It should be noted that they show a low response to NACT, only 6% have a complete response14

Luminal B subtype (E+, Pr+/-, HER2- and Ki-
67: 14-30%) Luminal B subtype cancers are E-receptor po-
sitive, although these are usually expressed in less quantity, they can be Pr-positive or not, HER2-negative with an intermediate proliferation index, greater than 14%, but less than 25-30% and they are generally of intermediate/high histological grade. Remember that most BRCA2 cancers belong to this group. These tumors can benefit from hormone therapy along with chemotherapy (CT)20
. The elevation of Ki-67
makes them grow faster than Luminal A and so have a worse prognosis.

HER2 positive cancers The HER2 proto-oncogene (or cerb-B-2) is found
on chromosome 17 and is over-expressed in many epithelial tumors. It encodes a protein in the mem- brane of malignant cells with tyrosine kinase activi- ty. In HER2-positive breast cancers that represent approximately 15-20% of breast carcinomas, tumor cells have additional copies of the HER2 gene and are often associated with alterations in other genes such as TOP2A, GATA4, angiogenesis genes, and proteolysis19. The Ki-67 is always high. They are usually of high histological grade and have a high proportion of mutations (40 to 80%) in p53 (a gene capable of detecting and repairing damaged DNA and causing cell death, its mutation increases the probability of suffering from cancer). The above explains why it is a more aggressive, fast growing subtype. They could be treated with specific drugs, targeting the HER2/neu protein: anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (Trastuzumab or Herceptin, Pertuzumab) in addition to surgery and chemotherapy (CT) treatment if necessary.

The overexpression of the HER2/neu protein can
be evaluated by IHC. 3+++ staining was defined semi- quantitatively as positive and 0 staining or a cross was negative. The 2++ cases require confirmation of amplification by the FISH technique (fluorescence in situ hybridization)3. It is important to distinguish 2 subgroups 1. One is called HER2 Luminal (E+, Pr+, HER2
and Ki-67: 15-30%). The tumor that belongs to this class has an
intermediate proliferation index, a Ki-67 of between 15-30%, and being HER2-positive, it also expresses hormonal receptors whether being of lower degree, therefore, apart from Herceptin, the hormone therapy is an additional therapeutic alternative. We could see it as a Luminal B HER2-positive3. It is also called a triple-positive tumor. 2. The other subgroup is called enriched HER2
(HER2+, E-, Pr-, Ki-67> 30%) These are very aggressive tumors with high Ki-
6721 that do not have E or Pr receptors, therefore, they do not respond to hormonal therapy. Although about half respond to targeted therapy (Herceptin) and show a better response to CT, the prognosis is poor.
Triple-negative receptor cancers (E-, Pr-, and HER2-) The word triple-negative is a nomenclature based
on IHC and refers to the phenotype of a group of tumors that are E, Pr, and HER2-negative, representing 15%
22
of breast cancers. Using the gene expression profile, it was found that it is a very heterogeneous group22
. It
has been classified into several additional subgroups that include Basal-like subtypes (BL1 and BL2), Claudin- low, mesenchymal (MES), luminal androgen receptor (LAR), immunomodulator (IM) among others23,24,25,26 the first two being the most frequent with 50-70% and 20-30% of cases. Why are they called basal-like? These tumors, unlike
Luminales, have gene expression patterns similar to the deepest, myoepithelial, basal component of the normal mammary gland, expressing high molecular weight cytokeratins (CK 5/6, CK 17) and are characterized by the absence of E receptor and HER2 gene expression. With additional IHC tests (which are not used in
daily practice), such as CK 5/6 and EGFR, they can also be divided into two major subgroups: if the tumor expresses both, it is Triple-negative receptor phenoty- pe, but it is called Basal-like type (70-80%). If it does not express these two markers, it will be Non-Basal- like, actually a quintuple negative receptor. Although it is true that most triple-negative receptor tumors fall within the Basal-like spectrum (BL1 and BL2), these two terms are not synonymous and there is at least 30% disagreement between both classifications (IHC vs molecular)27, 28
.
TN cancers are common in young women and
would have a worse prognosis in African American women29
. They usually have mutations in the p53

oncosuppressor gene. They are poorly differentiated cancers, histological grade III with a particularly high mitotic index, usually with lymphocytic infiltration, areas of tumor necrosis, central fibrosis and circumscribed contours, without a stromal reaction30
. They present an
aggressive behavior, with a high rate of local recurrence and early metastases, despite their high sensitivity to chemotherapy (CT) (Figures 2 and 3). 85% of BRCA1 tumors belong to this group31
. By immunophenotype (E-, Pr- and HER2-), several
low-grade carcinomas are also considered here, such as atypical medullary carcinoma, cystic adenoid, apo- crine, metaplastic variant squamous, adenosquamous, fibromatosis-like, etc.3
that have a better prognosis. In the
rest, total survival is low, because endocrine therapies and Herceptin are ineffective in this group of tumors. At the moment only chemotherapy (CT)25
is offered.
In patients with the BRCA1 mutation, certain PARP122 inhibitors may be effective. The LAR subtype could also be an interesting candidate for anti-androgen therapy6
.



The
first classification is Luminal A, which makes up 30-70% of all breast cancers. This subtype originates in the inner (luminal) cells lining the mammary ducts. It is hormone- dependent and tends to be estrogen receptor (ER)- and/or progesterone (PR)-positive, HER2-negative and displays low proliferative activity based on Ki67 expression. The second subtype is Luminal B, which has a prevalence of 10-20% of all breast cancers and is characterized by ER/ PR-positivity, high Ki67, and/or HER2-positivity. Patients
with



with Luminal A/B breast cancer have the best prognosis, and if they do progress to metastasis is usually to the bone[17]
. The third subtype HER2–enriched, with ER/PR
negativity and positive HER2, with a prevalence of 5-15% of all breast cancers. The fourth type is the triple negative/ basal-like (ER-/PR-/HER2-), with a prevalence of 15-20% of all breast cancers. The latter two subtypes (TN) are basal- like tumours, due to the tumor cells expressing similar features to those of the outer (basal) cells surrounding the mammary ducts. Triple negative (TN) breast tumors have the highest incidence of metastasis and show a high rate of metastasis to the lungs. The TN tumors are often more aggressive and have a poorer prognosis (at least within the first five years after diagnosis) compared to the ER- positive subtypes (Luminal A and Luminal B tumors)[20]



Here we present an integrated genomic strategy based on the use of gene expression signatures of oncogenic pathway activity (n = 52) as a framework to analyze DNA copy number alterations in combination with data from a genome-wide RNA-mediated interference screen. We identify specific DNA amplifications and essential genes within these amplicons representing key genetic drivers, including known and new regulators of oncogenesis. The genes identified include eight that are essential for cell proliferation (FGD5, METTL6, CPT1A, DTX3, MRPS23, EIF2S2, EIF6 and SLC2A10) and are uniquely amplified in patients with highly proliferative luminal breast tumors, a



we used a series of experimentally derived gene expression signatures that are capable of measuring oncogene or tumor suppressor pathway activ- ity, aspects of the tumor microenvironment and other tumor char- acteristics, including proliferation rate, as a framework by which to integrate multiple forms of genomic data

By further analyzing functional data from a genome-wide RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) screen9, we identified genes that are essential for cell viability in a pathway-dependent and, in some cases, subtype-dependent manner.





. Several studies illustrated that the presence of tumor infiltrating lympho- cytes was often associated with better prognosis several cancer types, including breast cancer12–21. Thus, inclusion of immune signatures in the molecular subtyping may provide additional information beyond routine prognosis in breast cancer. However, until now, no attempt has been made to use these immune signatures to stratify breast cancer



by using the gene expression profiles of immune-related genes with favorable prognosis, the
k-means clustering was applied on the breast cancer samples to establish a robust molecular classification. Then, the associations between the molecular clusters and prognosis, clinicopathological factors, immune-related fea- tures and tumor infiltrating levels were assessed. The



Human breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Using expression profiling Perou et al. [1] described several molecular subtypes among which are three main cat- egories: Luminal cancers that express Estrogen (ER) and/or Progesterone (PR) Receptors but lack Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2 (HER2); HER2- overexpressing cancers; and basal-like cancers that lack ER, PR and HER2. Luminal cancers are by far the most common (>70% of cases) and have the best prognosis among the three major subtypes [2]. Clinically Luminal cancers are treated with endocrine therapies like fulves- trant or tamoxifen that target ER or aromatase inhibitors that suppress estrogen production. Despite the initial effectiveness of these therapies, approximately one-third of Luminal cancers acquire hormone resistance, enhan- cing their aggressiveness and leading to local recurrence or distant metastases [3]. Several mechanisms have been proposed for growth resumption associated with loss of regulation by estrogens [4]. Here we address the role of the tumor microenvironment



triple-negative breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease characterized by a lack of hormonal receptors and HER2 overexpression. It is the only breast cancer subgroup that does not benefit from targeted therapies, and its prognosis is poor.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by a lack of ER and PR expression and a lack of HER2 overex-
pression. TNBC comprises a heterogeneous group of tumors. In 2000, Perou et al. proposed a classification of BC based on gene expression patterns. Most triple-negative tumors are included in the so-called basal-like molecular subgroup3, although both categories have up to 30% discordance4



In the present study, we applied probabilistic graphical models to a previously published TNBC cohort5. This
technique allows exploring the molecular information from a functional perspective.



Probabilistic graphical model analysis. A probabilistic graphical model compatible with a high-dimensionality approach to associate gene expression profiles, including the most variable 2000 genes, was performed as previously described18. Briefly, the resulting network, in which each node represents an individual gene, was split into several branches to identify functional structures within the network. Then, we used gene ontology analyses to investigate which function or functions were overrepresented in each branch, using the functional annotation chart tool provided by DAVID 6.8 beta19. We used “homo sapiens” as a background list and selected only GOTERM-DIRECT gene ontology categories and Biocarta and KEGG pathways. Functional nodes were composed of nodes presenting a gene ontology enriched category. To measure the functional activity of each functional node, the mean expression of all the genes included in one branch related to a concrete function was calculated. Differences in functional node activity were assessed by class comparison analyses. Finally, metanodes were defined as groups of related functional nodes using nonsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses.
Sparse k-means classification. Sparse k-means was used to establish the optimal number of tumor groups. This method uses the genes included in each node and metanode, as previously described20. Briefly, classification consistency was tested using random forest. An analysis using the consensus clustering algorithm21 as applied to the data containing the variables that were selected by the sparse K-means method22 has provided an optimum classification into two subtypes in previous studies20. In order to transfer the newly defined classification from the main dataset to other datasets, we constructed centroids for each defined subgroup, using genes included in various metanodes.
